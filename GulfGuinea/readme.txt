physics and biogeochemistry model for the COESSING 2023 summer school

The regional cutout is defined as follows:
  region_name='GulfGuinea';
  minlat=-13.5;
  maxlat=6.75;
  minlon=-9;
  maxlon=14;

v05
contains "ECCO-Darwin version 5" instructions and model configuration files
for installing and running the regional simulation
